iP Relay
--------

iP Relay is a message relaying service built for the use of the engineering, testing, and project management teams at Interactive Partners (http://www.ipartners.com/). It's primary purpose, at least for the moment, is to provide users of the Beanstalk source control system the ability to execute a few commands directly in commit messages.

The only message "origin" supported currently is Beanstalk (http://beanstalkapp.com/).

To configure:

  1. Open a repository
  2. Go to: Setup -> Integration -> Web hooks
  3. For SVN repositories, activate and point to this URL:

  4. For Git repositories, activate and point to this URL:
     http://ip-relay.your_domain_here.com/beanstalk/payload

Command syntax:

  * Surround each command in square brackets
  * Separate parameters with a comma
  * Separate parameter keys and values with a colon
  * Multiple commands are supported
  * Spaces are automatically stripped
